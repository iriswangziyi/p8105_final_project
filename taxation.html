<h2>Comparing the Local and State Tax to the Adjusted tax</h2>
<p>Now with these two tax measures it is interesting to see how they differ between state. Below we have took the difference between the local taxes and others with the adjusted. Most of the states have a value of just zero but the graph below just shows the states with a positive difference between the two measurements.</p>
